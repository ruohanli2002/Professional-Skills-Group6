The Blue Jay (Cyanocitta cristata) is a species of corvid widely distributed across North America, particularly in Florida. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, not only due to its striking appearance and intelligent behavior but also because of its influence on seed dispersal, forest regeneration, and ecological balance.

**Ecological Importance of Blue Jays**

Seed Dispersal and Forest Regeneration Blue Jays primarily feed on acorns and other nuts. They store these seeds in various locations to consume later; however, many of these seeds are never retrieved, leading to natural germination and contributing to forest expansion and renewal. Studies have shown that Blue Jays are significant seed dispersers in forests, selecting and transporting oak and American Chestnut seeds, thereby facilitating forest regeneration.Indicator Species for Ecosystem Health As a species sensitive to habitat changes, the population and health status of Blue Jays can serve as an indicator of environmental stability. Their presence (or absence) in an area can reflect the overall health of the ecosystem, as they are relatively sensitive to environmental changes. Studying their morphological traits (such as bill length, body mass, and skull length) provides valuable insights into their growth patterns and adaptations to environmental changes.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between bill length (BillLength) and body mass (Mass)in Blue Jays and determine whether additional factors, such as sex and skull length, improve predictive accuracy. Specifically, we address the following research questions:

1: **How well can body mass be predicted using a linear model with just one explanatory variable, namely bill length?**

2: **Would this model be improved by adding the birdâ€™s sex and/or skull length as further explanatory variables,and what evidence is there that, on average, the skull length differs for male and female birds?**
